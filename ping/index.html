<meta name="description" content="Ping is a network troubleshooting tool that is used to test the connectivity between two networked devices, typically a computer or a server and a domain name or IP address. The ping command sends a series of small packets of data to the target device and measures the time it takes for each packet to be transmitted and received. The results of these measurements, known as latency or round-trip time, can be used to assess the quality and speed of the network connection.">
